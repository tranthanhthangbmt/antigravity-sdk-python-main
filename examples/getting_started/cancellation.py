"""Example demonstrating programmatic and native task cancellation.

This example shows:
- Differentiating programmatic cancellation (aborted via response.cancel())
  from native Python task cancellation (aborted via task.cancel()).
- How to structure robust async exception handling for both scenarios using
  a centralized response rendering helper.
- Catching the custom AntigravityCancelledError (inheriting from CancelledError)
  to capture SDK-specific cancellation events.

To run:
  python cancellation.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. The output contains "[Programmatic Cancel Caught]" showing the
     SDK-specific cancellation was handled (or
     "[Chat task already completed, skipping cancellation.]" if generation
     completed prior to cancellation).
  3. The output contains "[Native Cancel Caught]" showing the standard Python
     cancellation was handled (or
     "[Chat task already completed, skipping cancellation.]" if generation
     completed prior to cancellation).
