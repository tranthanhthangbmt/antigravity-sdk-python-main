"""Multimodal example for Google Antigravity SDK.

This example demonstrates:
- Multimodal input: Passing images, documents, and audio to the agent.
- Multimodal output: Enabling the agent to generate images.
- Multimodal tool output: A custom tool returning media (an image), which is
  delivered to the model as supplemental media so it can "see" what the tool
  produced.

To run:
  python multimodal.py

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. The agent produces a non-empty description of the provided image.
  3. The agent produces a non-empty summary of the provided document.
  4. The agent produces a response for the provided audio file.
  5. The agent attempts to generate an image when asked.
  6. The agent describes the image returned by the `load_example_image` tool.
